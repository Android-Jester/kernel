#+title: Re-Linux_Kernel
#+DESCRIPTION: This is my custom implementation of the Linux kernel, the project starts after I have finished analysing the current Linux kernel


* Things to checkout
- [ ] Understand Zig and assembly(basics only, no need for standard library stuff)
- [ ] Learn to load a c library into Zig as some parts of the code might require me to write some C
- [ ] Learn how to use QEMU to emulate the kernel into display
- [ ] Make a bootloader to load the kernel into memory
- [ ] Acquire the pointer to the first bit of video memory and write data onto the screen
